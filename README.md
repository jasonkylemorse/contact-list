# Contact List Application
This is a simple contact list web application built using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, NodeJS). I followed along with the tutorial found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHV7gOHvNdk). Its associated code is derived from [here](https://github.com/michaelcheng429/meanstacktutorial). I will be building upon this application to familiarize myself with these services, and JS in general. 

### Directions
1. navigate to `/mongodb/3.2.0/bin` and run `mongod`
2. navigate to the contact-list project directory and run `node server.js`
3. point your browser to `localhost:3000`
